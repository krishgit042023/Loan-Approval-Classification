**ðŸ’³ Loan Approval Prediction**

A Machine Learning Classification Project
Predicting loan approval status based on applicant data using machine learning techniques.

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
**
Loan approval is a critical decision-making process for financial institutions. This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and loan amount. The objective is to build a robust classification model that helps streamline the loan approval process.
